#Nested Sampling: an efficient and robust Bayesian inference tool for Machine Learning and Data Science
hour-long seminar given on 14th November 2019 locally at the University of Cambridge, UK at the data science CDT seminar series

## Abstract

Nested sampling is an MCMC technique for integrating and exploring probability distributions. It has become widely
adopted in the field of cosmology as a powerful tool for computing Bayesian evidences and sampling challenging a-priori
unknown parameter spaces.

In this talk, I will give an introduction to the principles of Bayesian model comparison and parameter estimation, an
explanation of the theory of nested sampling, a survey of the current state-of-the art (MultiNest, PolyChord, DNest and
Dynesty) and the future of the field. I will illustrate with applications in CMB and 21cm Cosmology, Bayesian Sparse
Reconstruction and Bayesian Neural Networks.
