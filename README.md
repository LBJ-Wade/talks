# Quantifying cosmological tensions: Interpreting the DES evidence ratio

Talk given in July 2019 at University College London, UK 

## Abstract

Observational cosmology is close to breaking point. There is now a 4.9-sigma
tension between the expansion rate H_0 as inferred by CMB modelling and H_0 as
measured by supernovae observers. Other parameter tensions potentially exist
between alternative combinations of data, such as a DES and Planck (S_8 and
Omega_m), or Planck CMB and lensing (Omega_K). In these cases it is less
obvious how to quantify the level of tension in terms of "sigma", either due
to the high dimensionality of the parameter space, or the non-gaussianity of
the distributions.  Diagnosing the location and level of these tensions could
prove critical in determining their cause and resolution.

In this talk I will discuss recent research by Pablo Lemos and myself into
novel statistical ways to measure these tensions, how to quantify the number
of parameters a given experiment constrains, the calibration of the DES
evidence ratio, and the problems with principle component analysis (PCA).
