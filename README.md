# Quantised primordial power spectra 
 
half-hour talk given on 16th December 2019 at the [30th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics](https://texas2019.org/) in Portsmouth UK

## Abstract

Introducing a linearly quantized power spectrum with k0 = 3.225e-4/Mpc and spacing deltak = 2.257e-4/Mpc provides a better fit to the Planck 2018 observations than the concordance baseline, with delta chi squared = âˆ’8.55. Quantized primordial power spectra have implications for explaining features in the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, including the low-l suppression of power, the l~20-30 dip as well as oscillations at high multipoles. I will discuss these observations and several potential theories that predict quantized primordial power spectra, such as future conformal boundary cosmologies and kinetically dominated initial conditions for inflation.
