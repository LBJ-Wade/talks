# Nested Sampling: an efficient and robust Bayesian inference tool for astrophysics and cosmology

Talk given in May 2018 to the Imperial Center for Inference and Cosmology, London, UK

## Abstract
Nested sampling is an alternative MCMC technique for integrating and
exploring probability distributions. It has become widely adopted in the
field of cosmology as the de-facto tool for computing Bayesian evidences and
sampling challenging a-priori unknown parameter spaces.

In this talk, I will give an introduction to the principles of Bayesian model
comparison and parameter estimation, an explanation of the theory of nested
sampling, a survey of the current state-of-the art (MultiNest, PolyChord,
DNest and Dynesty) and the future of the field. Throughout I will illustrate
with examples of it's application in cosmology and astrophysics, ranging from
inflationary physics to exoplanets.
