# Compromise-free Bayesian sparse reconstruction

 
Talk given at [Likelihood-Free Inference Workshop](https://lfitaskforce.github.io/FlatironMeeting/) at the Flatiron institute, New York 

## Abstract

I will outline a general framework for performing a fully Bayesian approach to basis function fitting and sparse reconstruction, where the coefficients, basis function parameters and types are sampled and marginalised over. We will examine the question 'How far can one go without compromise or approximation', before using this framework to discuss approximation strategies. Further information can be found in the MNRAS paper:
