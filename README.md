# Maximum entropy priors with derived parameters in a specified distribution

Talk given at Battcock coffee-time mini seminar in Cambridge in May 2018

## Abstract
I will give a short talk on the result in this recent paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08143

I will illustrate the significance of the result using cosmological examples.
The result is of particular importance to those who use non-parametric
reconstruction techniques.

The start of the talk will also serve as an introduction to maximum entropy
methods.
