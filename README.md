# PolyChord 2.0: Advances in Nested Sampling with astrophysical applications

Talk given in Feb 2019 at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) Flatiron Institute, New York City, US

## Abstract

Nested sampling is an alternative to traditional MCMC tools for performing
numerical Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison.  It provides a
methodology for exploring multimodal and highly degenerate posterior
distributions. In addition to sampling the posterior for the purposes of
parameter estimation, it simultaneously integrates over the distribution to
compute the Bayesian evidence, a key quantity in Bayesian Model comparison.
The technique has been used extensively throughout Astrophysics, in particular
playing a key part in the Planck and LIGO analyses.

In this talk we begin by reviewing the theory of nested sampling along with
examples of implementations such as MultiNest. We then describe PolyChord, the
natural successor to MultiNest, as a tool for high-dimensional parameter
estimation. In addition, we shall discuss PolyChord's upcoming second version,
and the future of nested sampling in general. We finish by examining a few
representative applications of nested sampling and model comparison.

Anybody who uses Bayesian parameter estimation and/or model comparison in
their work will likely find this talk useful and informative, in particular
past or current MultiNest and PolyChord users.
