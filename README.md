# Polychord 2.0 and the future of nested sampling

Talk given in May 2016 at Sussex University, UK 

## Abstract

We discuss nested sampling as an alternative tool for parameter estimation and
model comparison. Advances in, and the future of the field are described, as
well as the improvements that polychord 2.0 will make.
