#Modern Bayesian Inference: Theory and Practice

Seminar given in Aachen RWTH in April 2017

Inference is the procedure by which we define and extract information from
data using scientific models. In this seminar we will cover the essential
elements of the theory and practice of modern Bayesian statistics. In the
context of scientific examples I shall discuss the importance of Parameter
Estimation and Model Comparison. I will survey the current numerical tools and
their state-of-the-art implementations: Metropolis-Hastings, Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo, The MCMC Hammer and Nested Sampling.
