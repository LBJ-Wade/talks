# Inflation, curvature and kinetic dominance
 
Talk given at [Future work with Planck data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/fwpd) meeting in ESAC spain

## Abstract

The paradox of observed fine-tuned spatial flatness is traditionally resolved by invoking inflation as a mechanism for flattening the universe. Given this, we cannot assume a-priori that the universe flat during inflation. This is in contrast to nearly all analyses and treatments, which usually assume a flat universe for expositional simplicity. In this talk I will discuss the interaction of inflation curvature, the theoretical implications for eternal inflation, observational implications for low-ell features and tensions, and present constraints on inflationary models in this regime.
