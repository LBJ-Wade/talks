# Curvature tension: Evidence for a closed universe (?)

Talk given in August 2019 at the University of Portmouth seminar series

## Abstract

The curvature parameter tension between Planck 2018, cosmic microwave
background lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillation data is measured using the
suspiciousness statistic to be 2.5 to 3Ïƒ. Conclusions regarding the spatial
curvature of the universe which stem from the combination of these data should
therefore be viewed with suspicion.  Without CMB lensing or BAO, Planck 2018
has a moderate preference for closed universes, with Bayesian betting odds of
over 50:1 against a flat universe, and over 2000:1 against an open universe.
