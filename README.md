# Nested Sampling: an efficient and robust Bayesian inference tool for cosmology and particle physics

Talk given to [DarkMachines](https://darkmachines.org/) community online in November 2018

## Abstract

Nested sampling is a technique for efficiently sampling a-priori unknown
likelihoods and computing Bayesian evidences, specialising in challenging
cases such as curving degeneracy and multimodality.  MultiNest has been
successfully applied across a broad range of sectors to low-dimensional
problems.  PolyChord represents the next generation of nested samplers,
capable of scaling to 100s--1000s of dimensions.

In this talk I shall explain the essence of nested sampling, why MultiNest is
so successful in low dimensions, why it cannot scale to 100s of dimensions,
how PolyChord offers an alternative, and future advances in the field.
