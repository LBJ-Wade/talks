# Bayesian methods for quantifying global parameter tensions between cosmological datasets

10 minute talk given on February 2021 at the [Tehran Meeting on Cosomology at the Crossroads](http://physics.sbu.ac.ir/conferences/tmcc2021/) 

## Abstract

The discrepancy between inferences and measurements of the Hubble constant
arising from early and late-time datasets is hard to miss. In other contexts
however, parameter tensions are more challenging to visualise and quantify.
Topical examples include:

(a) tensions between cosmic microwave background and weak lensing data, since
the tension arises in a non-trivial combination of parameters including
$\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$

(b) tensions arising from or resolved by extensions to $\Lambda$CDM such as
variable dark energy and/or spatial curvature which have non-linear
degeneracies.

In these cases the parameter tensions may be hidden or over-emphasised when
examining marginalised plots derived from a much higher-dimensional parameter
space (such as those produced by getdist or corner). More advanced 'global'
metrics are required to determine whether or not two experiments are in
tension, or whether a proposed solution actually resolves the discrepancy.

This talk will highlight the recent statistical and computational advances in
the theory of quantifying parameter tensions using a Bayesian and
information-theoretic approach, with a focus on the Suspiciousness statistic.

These techniques will be demonstrated with applications to modern datasets
such as Planck, ACT, SPT, DES, KiDS and SH0ES, and the current computational
state-of-the-art toolkits will be indicated. The headline result is a
technique and interpretation for computing the Suspiciousness statistic from
MCMC chains alone, without the requirement of an explicit Bayesian evidence
computation.
