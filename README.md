# PolyChord 2.0 and the future of nested sampling

Talk given in September 2016 at University College London, UK 

## Abstract
Nested sampling is an alternative tool for performing numerical Bayesian
parameter estimation and model comparison. It provides a methodology for
exploring multimodal and highly degenerate posterior distributions. In
addition to sampling the posterior for the purposes of parameter estimation,
it simultaneously integrates over the distribution to compute the Bayesian
evidence, a key quantity in Bayesian Model selection. The technique has been
used extensively throughout Astrophysics, in particular playing a key part in
the Planck and LIGO analyses.

In this talk we begin by reviewing the theory of nested sampling along with
examples of its implementation such as MultiNest. We then describe PolyChord,
the natural successor to MultiNest, as a tool for high-dimensional parameter
estimation. In addition, we shall discuss PolyChord's upcoming second version,
and the future of nested sampling in general. We finish by examining a few
scientific applications of nested sampling.

Anybody who uses Bayesian parameter estimation and/or model selection in their
work will likely find this talk useful and informative, in particular past or
current MultiNest and PolyChord users.
