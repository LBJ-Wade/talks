# Bayesian inference: The state of the art in cosmology and astrophysics

Talk given in October 2018 in Cambridge at the Third Asterics-Obelics workshop

## Abstract

Cosmology has long pioneered the application of Bayesian inference techniques
in astrophysics in the context of cosmological parameter estimation and model
comparison. In this talk I shall explain the key concepts of Bayesian
inference with astrophysical examples, give an overview of the currently
available tools and techniques to implement them, and present a survey of the
future direction of the field.
